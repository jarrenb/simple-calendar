# simple calendar

a calendar page with a monthly view

on windows you can click the time in the bottom right and it shows you a handy little monthly view. it's fantastic. on mac, this is not the case. i don't know why but i look at the month a lot. this is not easy on a mac. i thought i'd make a website that i could go to that would show me the monthly view of the month we're currently in, and maybe that would be a fun way of solving my ridiculous problem
